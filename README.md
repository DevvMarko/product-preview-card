## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I've become more familiar with media queries from project to project, and I've also learned what breakpoints work best for certain devices. That's very helpful.


### Useful resources

- [Media Queries Breakpoints](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me figure out what minimum layout width I should set depending on my screen size.
